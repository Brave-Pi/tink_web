# Tinkerbell Web Routing

In simple terms, `tink_web` is a super-charged proxy and router for `tink_http`, that strives to embed the semantics of REST and HTTP into Haxe in a seamless way.

It is composed of three parts:
  
1. Client side proxies
2. Server side routing
3. Server side reverse routing

# Client side proxies

Client side proxies allow you to make calls against APIs over HTTP.
